# blackjack

in this version of blackjack you are playing against the computer dealer. both start out with two cards each out of which one of dealer's card is turned down and other is turned up at the start.
Your goal is to get as close to 21 as possible , if you go over you'll bust and you'll lose immediately.

once you are happy with your cards the computer dealers turn starts and he draws until he either- busts over 21 or beats your score.

at the start of each round you bet some money and if you win that round the dealer gives you double of thtat bet back or else he pockets that bet. in the latest version you start off with 1000 money to play with and can go in debt .

please note that the face cards value is equal to 10 . and the Ace automatically values either 11 or 1 depending on what is best for both of you.

Have fun!
